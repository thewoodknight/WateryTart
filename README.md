### Requirements
All installers should be self contained and have no external dependencies. The only requirement is that you have a Music Assistant instance running somewhere on your network.

## Notes
### Updates
Win-x64, Linux-x64 and Linux-arm64 all feature autoupdates through Velopack. Unfortunately I do not have access to a mac to test the workflow properly, so it still relies on manual updating.

### Raspberry Pi
Raspbian's default Desktop Environment doesn't implement touchscreen gestures like scrolling. As a result, if you're using a touchscreen, don't use the default Rasbian desktop environment. Instead, use something like [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop) or [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/), which do support touchscreen gestures.


### Whats with the name?
WateryTart is uses Avalonia, which sounds like it comes from Camelot, and "You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!".
